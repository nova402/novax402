## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Method

Email security reports to: **security@nova402.com**

Include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
4. **Suggested fix** (if any)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Regular code security audits
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Go
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

### Cryptographic Security

- **EIP-712 Signatures**: Standard Ethereum signatures for EVM chains
- **Ed25519 Signatures**: Solana-compatible signatures
- **Secure Random**: Cryptographically secure randomness for nonces
- **No Private Key Storage**: Never store private keys

### Payment Security

- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based replay attack prevention
- **Time Windows**: Limited validity periods for payments
- **Amount Verification**: Strict amount and recipient validation
- **On-chain Verification**: All payments verifiable on blockchain

### Network Security

- **TLS Required**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all connections
- **Rate Limiting**: DDoS protection
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin policies
- **API Key Rotation**: Regular key rotation recommended

## Best Practices

### For Service Providers

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit private keys or secrets
2. **Wallet Security**: Use hardware wallets for production treasury
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on paid endpoints
4. **Logging**: Log all payment attempts (but not sensitive data)
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual payment patterns

### For Developers

1. **Private Key Management**: Use secure key management (Vault, KMS)
2. **Amount Limits**: Set maximum payment amounts in client
3. **Network Verification**: Always verify network matches expectations
4. **Signature Verification**: Always verify signatures before accepting payments
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose internal errors to clients

### For Users

1. **Wallet Approval**: Review all payment authorizations before signing
2. **Amount Check**: Verify payment amounts before approving
3. **Network Verification**: Confirm correct network before transactions
4. **Monitor Transactions**: Track all payments on block explorers
5. **Revoke Permissions**: Revoke unused payment authorizations

## Known Security Considerations

### EIP-3009 Authorization

- Uses `transferWithAuthorization` which requires facilitator to submit
- Nonce must be unique and tracked on-chain
- Signature verification happens before settlement

### Facilitator Trust

- Facilitators can see payment authorizations
- Choose reputable facilitators (e.g., PayAI Network)
- Can verify payments locally without facilitator

### Smart Contract Dependencies

- USDC contracts must be EIP-3009 compliant
- Contract addresses hardcoded and verified
- No proxy contracts to prevent upgradability risks

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report privately first
2. **Coordination**: Work together on fix and timeline
3. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinate public announcement
4. **Credit**: Security researchers credited (unless anonymous preferred)

## Bug Bounty

We do not currently have a formal bug bounty program, but we appreciate security research and may offer rewards for critical findings on a case-by-case basis.

## Security Updates

Security updates are announced:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Primary channel
- **Discord**: #security-announcements channel
